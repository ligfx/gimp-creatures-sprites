Creatures Sprites GIMP PlugIn 
====================

Copyright (C) 2001  Tina Hirsch <tehirsch@nexgo.de>


This plugin currently can load and save 
c16, s16 and blk images from the Creatures series.

Black (0,0,0) is converted to transparent like in the game
during loading and transparent in the image is converted 
to black when saving.

The c16 and s16 plugins handle the different images in one 
sprite via layers. The first image at the lowest layer
and the last on the top.

You can preview an animation by a rightclick in the image 
and choosing Filter->Animation->Play Animation.
Seperating the images from a sprite to single files and the
other way around is possible by rightclick and 
Video->Split Image to Frames respectively 
Video->Frames to Image. Please look for more information
about this in the GIMP User-manual.
